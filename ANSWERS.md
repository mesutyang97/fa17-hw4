4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?
It is a bit longer. I found it more difficult to implement the form_for because the demo during lecture was basically at the speed of light. A video walkthrough of the demo is much appreciated.
